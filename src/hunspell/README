o General

It is an Uzbek dictionary for Hunspell, which is supposed to be a spellcheckers
framework for the OpenOffice.org-2 and its newer versions.

o Make

To create an Uzbek dictionary from the uzbek-wordlist in the parent directory,
in Linux run the following command in this directory:

$ make

If everything goes fine, there should be non-empty uz_UZ.dic file created.

o Install for OpenOffice.org

At the moment, one has to manually install it. To do so, copy uz_UZ.aff and
uz_UZ.dic files into $OOo/share/dict/ooo In this case, $OOo is a directory
where OpenOffice.org is installed (for example, it might be /usr/lib/ooo-2). 

Now, add the following line to $OOo/share/dict/ooo/dictionary.lst

DICT uz UZ uz_UZ

o Using with OpenOffice.org

Start OpenOffice.org Writer. Right click somewhere on the page and choose
"Character..." from the pop-up menu. Now, select Uzbek (Latin) from the language
list in the Font tab. There should be a spellcheck icon next to Uzbek (Latin)
meaning that there is a dictionary for this language.

Yes, I know this dictionary is not for Uzbek (Latin), but for Uzbek (Cyrillic).
Unfortunately, current OpenOffice.org (2.0.3) does not support different
scripts for the same language.
